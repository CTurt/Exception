Exception
=========
Small library for exception handling in C.

Works similarly to exception handling in higher level languages such as JavaScript. For a complete example, see [sample.c](https://github.com/CTurt/Exception/blob/master/sample.c).

Combine with my [Preoop library](https://github.com/CTurt/Preoop) for [some very high level C code](https://gist.github.com/CTurt/b94b5c475f27003886ba).
